JaztecCmsCore
=============

Core module for the JaztecCms. Just another CMS based on ZF2, no fancy ambitions.

The Core contains some base entities and functionality. The Core also provides an
integration interface for combining entities from any user project/module to entities
inside the JaztecCms.

## Goal
The goal with this CMS is to create a dynamic CMS system with an AngularJS front-end.
A ExtJS administration front-end on which the configuration is dynamicly injected with
used modules all based on one ZF2 based application.

## Base entities
- Pages
- Sections
- Articles

## Dependancies

- zendframework/ZF2
